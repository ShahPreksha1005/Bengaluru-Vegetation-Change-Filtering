### **Assignment: Vegetation Change Map of Bengaluru (2006-2019) Using Non-Linear Spatial Filtering**  

This assignment focuses on applying **non-linear spatial filtering techniques** to satellite imagery for **Earth Science applications**. The primary objective is to **enhance and analyze a vegetation change map of Bengaluru (2006-2019)** by reducing noise, highlighting features, and improving image clarity.  

The implementation includes:  
✅ **Median Filter** – Reduces noise while preserving edges  
✅ **Max & Min Filters** – Highlight bright/dark areas respectively  
✅ **Midpoint Filter** – Balances brightness and darkness  
✅ **Alpha-Trimmed Mean Filter** – Reduces outliers while retaining details  

The results demonstrate how different filters modify the image, aiding in better **remote sensing analysis** for environmental monitoring and land-use planning.
