# Bengaluru-Vegetation-Change-Filtering
This assignment applies non-linear spatial filtering techniques to enhance a vegetation change map of Bengaluru (2006-2019). Filters like median, max, min, midpoint, and alpha-trimmed mean are used to reduce noise, highlight features, and improve clarity. The analysis aids in better remote sensing for environmental monitoring and land-use planning.
